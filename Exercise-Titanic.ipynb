identify parts of names that correlate well with the **Survived** attribute (e.g. if the name contains \"Countess\", then survival seems more likely),\n","* try to convert numerical attributes to categorical attributes: for example, different age groups had very different survival rates (see below), so it may help to create an age bucket category and use it instead of the age. Similarly, it may be useful to have a special category for people traveling alone since only 30% of them survived (see below)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vUOAqqVdArOt","colab_type":"code","outputId":"cc50d1db-24c4-4842-d0f1-3f782069c521","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1559584514308,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":4485,"user":{"displayName":"wakakap","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-A2MuK8-EiCA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAII/DsqFnQGwIHg/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"09927340887048176321"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":254}},"source":["train_data[\"AgeBucket\"] = train_data[\"Age\"] // 15 * 15\n","train_data[[\"AgeBucket\", \"Survived\"]].groupby(['AgeBucket']).mean()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Survived</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>AgeBucket</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0.0</th>\n","      <td>0.576923</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>15.0</th>\n","      <td>0.362745</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>30.0</th>\n","      <td>0.423256</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>45.0</th>\n","      <td>0.404494</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>60.0</th>\n","      <td>0.240000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>75.0</th>\n","      <td>1.000000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["           Survived\n","AgeBucket          \n","0.0        0.576923\n","15.0       0.362745\n","30.0       0.423256\n","45.0       0.404494\n","60.0       0.240000\n","75.0       1.000000"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":28}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"cfj2ONsSArO1","colab_type":"code","outputId":"e32dce8b-0b5c-4df2-c6c2-c2e839493049","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1559584514312,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":4470,"user":{"displayName":"wakakap","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-A2MuK8-EiCA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAII/DsqFnQGwIHg/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"09927340887048176321"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":343}},"source":["train_data[\"RelativesOnboard\"] = train_data[\"SibSp\"] + train_data[\"Parch\"]\n","train_data[[\"RelativesOnboard\", \"Survived\"]].groupby(['RelativesOnboard']).mean()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Survived</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>RelativesOnboard</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0.303538</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>0.552795</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>0.578431</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>0.724138</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>0.200000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>0.136364</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>0.333333</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <td>0.000000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>10</th>\n","      <td>0.000000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                  Survived\n","RelativesOnboard          \n","0                 0.303538\n","1                 0.552795\n","2                 0.578431\n","3                 0.724138\n","4                 0.200000\n","5                 0.136364\n","6                 0.333333\n","7                 0.000000\n","10                0.000000"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":29}]}]}
